## Slide 1: Introduction to the Shiny App

The Shiny app allows users to input their name and get a personalized greeting. It includes:
- A text input for the user's name.
- A button to generate the greeting.

## Slide 2: App Input and Output

The app takes user input (a name) and produces an output (a greeting message). Users can enter their name and click **Go!** to see the result.

## Slide 3: How It Works (Server Side)

The server listens for user input and processes the text input using the `textInput()` widget. When the button is clicked, the greeting is displayed in the main panel.

## Slide 4: Example of App Output

```{r}
# Example of what the output might look like:
paste("Hello, John Doe!")
